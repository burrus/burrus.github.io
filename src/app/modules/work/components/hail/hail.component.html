  <p>Hail was a photo-messaging app, inspired by Snapchat, built entirely in Objective-C
    using <a href="https://parseplatform.org/" target="_blank">Parse</a> as the back-end. The app is no longer
    available on the app store.</p>
  <p>Hail was built in conjunction with my <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/scholarships/" target="_blank">WWDC scholarship</a>
    application. I applied for one of the WWDC scholarships through an organization known as the
    <a href="https://www.tmcf.org/" target="_blank">Thurgood Marshall College Fund</a> back in 2015. I was lucky
    enough to have been selected for one of the scholarships and got to spend a week in San Francisco
    attending the conference.</p>
