  <p>Stormy was a single-page weather app that allowed you to quickly grab the weather forecast
    from anywhere in the world. I used the <a href="https://darksky.net/dev" target="_blank">
    Dark Sky Weather API</a> to grab weather conditions. This app was based on an app from
    <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/burrus" target="_blank">Treehouse</a>, but I expanded upon
    it by adding several other features.</p>
