            <p>I was the sole designer on the team and was responsible for all of the wireframes and mockups, as well as the prototype. We conducted the user research and created the presentation together as a team.</p>

                <p>College students need to get things done and either don’t know how, don’t have time, or don’t have money.</p>

            <h3>Our Users</h3>
            <img id="college-students" src="img/college-students.jpg" alt="">
            <p>We knew our users were college students, but we wanted to get a better idea of who they were and what they did on a daily basis. To do this, we visited several college campuses and talked with any and all students that would give us the time of day. We went equipped with questionnaires and tried to target high-traffic areas of campus such as the student union and cafeteria. We spent time with small and large groups of students alike, and after more than 50 conversations we started to see a common theme.</p>

        <div class="blue-block">

            <p>This really is the premise of the idea and in talking to students, we came across countless examples of potential exchanges. “I’m terrible at Math, but I know how to fix cars.” Some weird ones like “If someone would wait in line for me at the ticket office, I’d do their laundry.” And some students even claimed that they already sort of exchange services with their friends. “My friend doesn’t have a car so sometimes he’ll advertise my university organization's program on Instagram and I’ll drive him to the store.”</p>
            <p>Those are just a few of the essentially infinite number of exchanges that our solution can facilitate. The next step, specifically for me, was to figure out how this would work on the internet.</p>

            <h3>Keeping It Simple</h3>
            <p>I remember one student saying “Good luck man, this sounds really complicated.” Well, thanks man. Challenge accepted?</p>

            <p>It was hard trying to figure out where to begin, but luckily we had a lot of user data; not to mention I was a student as well so it was easy to place myself in the shoes of the user. Location-based, geofencing, timeline, explore, reviews; these were just a few of the words that started to pop in my head.</p>
            <img id="whiteboard" src="img/sitemap.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Four tabs is what I came up with: Timeline, Explore, Exchanges, Profile. I also mapped out the journey of how the app would facilitate an exchange. I tried to keep it as streamlined as possible. User posts a need and what they are willing to exchange for. Second user views post, this user can do what the OP needs and needs what the OP can do. Second user sends request to start exchange. OP accepts request. Exchange occurs. Great success.</p>

            <h3>Mobile-Focused</h3>
            <p>We decided to totally forgo the web, at least to start out. We figured that in order for this to work, students need to be able to access it from their phones.</p>

            <p>When a user opens our app they’ll see a timeline of posts in their area. They can adjust the geofence radius to include other colleges in the area. They can also create a new post from the home page.</p>

            </div>
            <p>If a user clicks on a post, they can read the post and see who posted it. If they click on the poster’s name, they’ll be taken to the poster’s profile. Profiles have reviews that other users have left as well as services a particular user can do.</p>

            <p>The most interesting part of this was how to tackle communication between two users. Sometimes a user may be able to do something close to what another user needs; this still has potential for an exchange but it will require the users to talk with each other. And constant communication between two exchangers can only help, after all.</p>
            <p>If a user decides that a post is a fit for them, they can proceed to request an exchange also having the ability to contact the poster beforehand.</p>

            </div>
            <p>In the exchanges tab, the user can see all of their past and pending exchanges with other users. When a user receives a request, they have the ability to either decline, accept, or edit (negotiate) it. Once accepted, the app waits for the users to declare that the exchange has been completed. Then, the users must rate and review each other.</p>
